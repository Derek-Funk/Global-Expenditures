				<h1>DATS 6401 | Visualization of Complex Data | Individual Project</h1>
				<p>
					This is the first project in the George
					Washington University's Visualization of Complex
					Data, led by Dr. Nima Zahadat. This assignment
					utilizes a variety of contemporary technologies
					to visually examine some of the top nations' spending on
					education, healthcare, and the military, as well as
					how they relate to the nations' overall spending,
					GDP, and population.
				</p>
				<p>
					Specific details on what data was used for
					this project can be read in the <em>Data Sources</em>
					tab.

					<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
					<p>
						Here is a summary of the various tools
						summoned upon in this project:
						<ol>
							<li>
								<b>HTML/CSS/JS</b>: These are used for a
								lot of the word processing and
								displays. This <em>Preface</em>
								section, for example, is made of
								HTML & CSS.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Google Chart API</b>: This API is
								heavily relied upon for all the
								data visualizations. You can find
								extensive documentation on it here:
								<a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/chart/</a>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>R/Shiny</b>:
								<ul>
									<li>
										R is used for all the pre-processing that is done
										to get raw data sources into formats that can be
										easily read by the visualizations created from
										the Google Chart API.
									</li>
									<li>
										Shiny is an R package that allows you to perform
										front-end web programming purely with the R language.
										Essentially, the Shiny framework is a library of R
										commands that translate directly to HTML, CSS,
										and JavaScript. The navigation pane to the left,
										for example, was created with Shiny (try clicking on
										the 3-line icon to the upper-left). Documentation
										on this framework can be found here:
										<a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">https://shiny.rstudio.com/</a>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
