				<h1>World Bank</h1>
				<p>
					This project relies entirely on the World Bank for data. The World Bank's 
					<a href="https://data.worldbank.org/" target="_blank">open data collection</a>
					has a wide variety of data sets on global development.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The main reason for deciding to use just one data source was to avoid data inconsistencies
					that might occur from pulling from multiple sources with different collection methods.
					
					However, this also meant that certain nations and years were omitted from this project due to
					large amounts of missing data from the World Bank. This restricts the analysis of global spending
					on education, healthcare, and the military to the years 2010-2015, and to the following nations:
					<ul>
						<li>Australia</li>
						<li>Brazil</li>
						<li>France</li>
						<li>Germany</li>
						<li>Indonesia</li>
						<li>Italy</li>
						<li>Japan</li>
						<li>Mexico</li>
						<li>South Africa</li>
						<li>South Korea</li>
						<li>United Kingdom</li>
						<li>United States</li>
					</ul>

				<h1>Pre-Processing</h1>
				<p>
					Here is a visualization of how R was used to take the raw data files from the World Bank
					and pre-process all other derived files:<br><br>
